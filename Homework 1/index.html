  <h1 id="greeting">Welcome to my first Website!</h1>
  <br>
  <h2 id="birthname">Francisco Mejia</h2>
  <br>
  <p> Thanks for time out of your life to visit my first website! Up until recently, I was an English instructor at Queensborough Community College. I graduated with my Bachelor's degreee in English in June 2020. I like to read books and play basketball in my spare time.</p>
  <br>
  <p>My interest in tech first began I was hanging out with my closest friends. We all met in high school back in 2012 and have always kept in touch since. They all have careers in tech ranging data scientist to dev ops and so I would always be privy to their conversations whenever we hung out. I asked all about how to begin working on my own side projects and from there, my interest blossomed.<br>Join me as I embark on a journey of a lifetime!</p>
